Simulated IoT weather station using ESP32, DHT22, and OLED on Wokwi
# 🌤️ IoT Weather Station Simulator (ESP32 + Wokwi)

This project simulates an IoT-based weather station using an ESP32 microcontroller on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), a browser-based hardware simulator.

It reads **temperature and humidity** from a virtual DHT22 sensor, displays the data on a simulated OLED screen, and logs readings to the Serial Monitor every 3 seconds.
